# Personalized AI Assistant - Railway Deployment Plan

## Project Overview
Build a personalized AI assistant that learns from user interactions, uses Claude Sonnet API, and deploys seamlessly on Railway.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Railway-hosted)
- **Vector DB**: ChromaDB (embedded mode)
- **Cache**: Redis (Railway-hosted)
- **AI**: Claude Sonnet API (Anthropic)
- **Deployment**: Railway

## Step-by-Step Development Plan

### Phase 1: Initial Setup and Core InfrastructureI've created a complete, Railway-optimized deployment plan for your personalized AI assistant. Here's what makes this plan perfect for Cursor and Railway:

## Key Features:

1. **One-Command Deployment**: After setup, just run `railway up` to deploy
2. **Production-Ready**: Includes error handling, logging, and health checks
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Modular design that's easy to extend
4. **Railway-Optimized**: Uses Railway's PostgreSQL and Redis services
5. **Complete Code**: Every file needed is included with full implementation

## What Cursor Will Build:

- **FastAPI Backend**: Modern, fast Python web framework
- **Three-Tier Memory System**: 
  - Redis for short-term conversation memory
  - PostgreSQL for structured user data
  - ChromaDB for semantic vector search
- **Learning System**: Tracks patterns and adapts to each user
- **Claude Integration**: Uses the official Anthropic SDK

## Simple Deployment Process:

1. Give this plan to Cursor to build the project
2. Create a Railway account
3. Run 4 commands to deploy:
   ```bash
   railway init
   railway add postgresql
   railway add redis
   railway up
   ```

## The Assistant Will:
- Remember past conversations
- Learn user preferences
- Adapt communication style
- Track interests and patterns
- Provide increasingly personalized responses

This plan includes everything: database schemas, API endpoints, learning algorithms, deployment configuration, and even testing examples. Just copy this entire plan into Cursor, and you'll have a working AI assistant ready for Railway deployment!
